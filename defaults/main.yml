# defaults file for user settings

# If the password of the user running ansible changes
# this variable needs to have the new password, so
# ansible_become_pass and ansible_ssh_pass can be updated
# Store the password on another file and encrypt it with vault.
#user_new_password: "{{ vault_admin_password }}"

# indicates if single user mode is to be configured
# (needs to have root password set)
user_configure_single_user: no

## Password settings ##

# Number of days before password expire
user_max_days: 365

# Number of days until user is allowed to change password
user_min_days: 7

# Number of days before user is considered inactive
user_inactive_days: 30

# Number of days before password expire that will
# generate a warning to the user
user_warn_age: 7

# UMASK to be used by all users
#user_umask: '027'

# Shell timeout in seconds
user_shell_timeout: 900

# Should tasks be executed to fix existing user accounts?
user_fix_existing_accounts: yes

## OPTIONAL VARIABLES ##

# If set to MD5, MD5-based algorithm will be used for encrypting password
# If set to SHA256, SHA256-based algorithm will be used for encrypting password
# If set to SHA512, SHA512-based algorithm will be used for encrypting password
# If set to BCRYPT, BCRYPT-based algorithm will be used for encrypting password
# If set to YESCRYPT, YESCRYPT-based algorithm will be used for encrypting password
# If set to DES, DES-based algorithm will be used for encrypting password
#user_encrypt_method: "SHA512"

# Only works if ENCRYPT_METHOD is set to SHA256 or SHA512.
#
# Define the number of SHA rounds.
# With a lot of rounds, it is more difficult to brute-force the password.
# However, more CPU resources will be needed to authenticate users if
# this value is increased.
#user_sha_crypt_max_rounds: 5000

# Only works if ENCRYPT_METHOD is set to BCRYPT.
#
# Define the number of BCRYPT rounds.
# With a lot of rounds, it is more difficult to brute-force the password.
# However, more CPU resources will be needed to authenticate users if
# this value is increased.
#user_bcrypt_min_rounds: 13
#user_bcrypt_max_rounds: 31

# Only works if ENCRYPT_METHOD is set to YESCRYPT.
#
# Define the YESCRYPT cost factor.
# With a higher cost factor, it is more difficult to brute-force the password.
# However, more CPU time and more memory will be needed to authenticate users
# if this value is increased.
#user_yescrypt_cost_factor: 5
